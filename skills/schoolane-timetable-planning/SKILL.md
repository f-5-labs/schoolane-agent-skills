name: schoolane-timetable-planning
description: Inspect, prepare, generate, and revise unpublished SchooLane school timetable drafts with server-enforced school-admin access, explicit consent, idempotency, and revision control. Use when an authorized administrator asks to plan a term timetable, identify clashes, create a draft, generate a first pass, move one lesson, pin a lesson, or record one teacher-unavailable slot. Not for publishing, deleting, importing, replacing an entire timetable, or changing live class timetables.

# Plan SchooLane timetables

Use SchooLane's deterministic scheduler to prepare a school-wide timetable draft. The AI may reason about priorities, but it must never invent or submit arbitrary lesson-card arrays.

Read [tool map](references/tool-map.md) before calling tools.

## Establish authority and period

1. Call `get_my_school_context` first. Continue with timetable reads only when the returned capability permits them.
2. Treat timetable draft changes as unavailable unless the signed-in user is a current school administrator, `timetable:write` is consented, and the timetable capability is active. Never infer these from the user's message.
3. Resolve the intended academic year and term using SchooLane-provided ids. Call `timetable_get_planning_context` before creating or changing a draft.
4. For an existing project, call `timetable_get_project_draft` and `timetable_get_project_conflicts` before proposing a change. Use the returned `revision` exactly as the next mutation's `baseRevision`.

## Draft a safe timetable workflow

1. Create only an unpublished project with `timetable_create_project_draft`. Give it a specific name and a new idempotency key.
2. Use `timetable_generate_project_draft` for the first placement pass. The server scheduler preserves pins, respects configured teacher-unavailable slots, and reports unplaced activities and teacher collisions.
3. Resolve one issue at a time: move exactly one unpinned card, set exactly one card pin, set one teacher-unavailable slot, or update bounded project settings. Use a fresh idempotency key for every distinct operation.
4. When inclusion grades or the bell schedule change, treat existing placements as invalidated. Explain that the draft must be generated again; do not reconstruct cards yourself.
5. After any successful write, report the new revision and conflict counts, then offer the SchooLane review link or the timetable preview app. Keep publication as a human action in SchooLane.

## Handle denial, contention, and uncertainty

- If the role, consent, or entitlement blocks a write, provide a read-only planning recommendation. Do not retry or route around the denial.
- If a write reports a stale revision, reload the project and conflicts, show the change that was attempted, and ask whether to reapply it. Never force or merge blindly.
- Repeating the same operation after a transport failure must reuse the same idempotency key and identical payload. A changed operation requires a new key.
- Do not guess foreign class, teacher, project, day, or slot ids. Do not use one-class planning to ignore shared-teacher conflicts elsewhere in the project.

## Hard boundaries

Never call or imply the existence of `timetable_publish`, `timetable_delete_project`, `timetable_import`, `timetable_save_full_draft`, `timetable_upsert_class`, or `timetable_save_live_class`. Do not claim a timetable is live, published, approved, or communicated to staff. Never request student records, guardian data, staff contact details, credentials, or unrelated operational writes for timetable planning.

## Example requests

- “Create a Term 1 timetable draft for Junior School and generate a first pass.”
- “Show the teacher collisions in this timetable and propose the smallest safe set of moves.”
- “Ms Okafor is unavailable Tuesday first period; update the draft but do not publish anything.”
